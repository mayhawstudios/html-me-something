                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <img src="" alt="Picture of Beijing Airport">

                <p>In college, I didn't have any options to study abroad.  One of my majors
                    didn't have any places to travel, and the other one did, but I didn't have
                    much money at the time and when an opportunity did come up, I was already
                    in my last semester before graduating.  When I finally found a job and started
                    my career, one of my sisters was planning on getting married while the other
                    one got a chance to go abroad to China.  I thought that my chance to 
                    do something exciting and new had passed me by, but then I was told I could pay
                    to be a chapperone and I lept at the chance!  After several months of payment,
                    passport and visa applications, I finally got to go someplace amazing!
                </p>

                <p>Here are just some of the places I got to see in China:</p>

                <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
                <img src="" alt="Me walking the Great Wall of China">
                <p>There are actually multiple sections of the wall to visit, but we went
                    to just one of the parts.  And on this part of the wall, there are two
                    paths to the top.  One gently slopes and the other is harder to scale. I
                    chose the harder route.  Over thousands of years and tourists (Chinese
                    and foreign, to some more rural parts of China, Beijing is considered a 
                    huge tourist site) the steps have worn down and not evenly.  So some steps
                    were barely taller than the previous ones, and some were huge!  I made it to
                    the top eventually, but going down was much harder because of how big the slope
                    was.

                <h2>Chinese Tea Ceremony</h2>
                <img src="" alt="Chinese tea cups">
                <p>I was more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker before moving to China, but
                    after drinking jasmine tea with every meal and a ceremonial tea ceremony got
                    me even more into tea!  In a traditional tea ceremony, the tea is quickly rinsed
                    with hot water to remove into any impurities and open the tea up, then the water is
                    poured through a slotted bamboo table into a bin below.  Then the tea is steeped in
                    a kettle and poured into glasses.  The long thin glass is for smelling the tea, then
                    the tea is poured into the bowl-shaped tea cup for drinking.
                </p>
                <p>We tried a variety of teas such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ginsing Oolong</li>
                    <li>Jasmine Pearls</li>
                    <li>Black Tea with Rosebuds</li>
                    <li>Dried Fruit Tea (Tisane)</li>
                    <li>Pu'erh (Aged black tea)</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
