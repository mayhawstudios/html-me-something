            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In college, I didn't have any options to study abroad.  One of my majors
                didn't have any places to travel, and the other one did, but I didn't have
                much money at the time and when an opportunity did come up, I was already
                in my last semester before graduating.  When I finally found a job and started
                my career, one of my sisters was planning on getting married while the other
                one got a chance to go abroad to China.  I thought that my chance to 
                do something exciting and new had passed me by, but then I was told I could pay
                to be a chapperone and I lept at the chance!  After several months of payment,
                passport and visa applications, I finally got to go someplace amazing!
