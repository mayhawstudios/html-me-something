                <img src="" alt="Picture of Beijing Airport">

                <p>In college, I didn't have any options to study abroad.  One of my majors
                    didn't have any places to travel, and the other one did, but I didn't have
                    much money at the time and when an opportunity did come up, I was already
                    in my last semester before graduating.  When I finally found a job and started
                    my career, one of my sisters was planning on getting married while the other
                    one got a chance to go abroad to China.  I thought that my chance to 
                    do something exciting and new had passed me by, but then I was told I could pay
                    to be a chapperone and I lept at the chance!  After several months of payment,
                    passport and visa applications, I finally got to go someplace amazing!
